        "text": 'The creation, popularity and demise of Route 66 has been set around some major events in US history and as such its actually a really important historic monument. This is why its being protected and revived in many places along the route. Route 66 began when paved roads werent even a thing in the west of the US and its grown up around the growth of the car as a way of life. It was there as families wanted to have a vacation and explore more of the country. It saw the migration of many people after the depression and the dust bowl catastrophe in Oklahoma. Some went westward to California in search of a better life (as told in the book The Grapes of Wrath) and some went north to Chicago and the industrial cities of the mid west. Route 66 tells the story of westward expansion in more modern times but also of the endless desire to move forward with technology. Route 66 overtook the railroads which were the peak of transport at their time and then saw as Interstates and other highways overtook it afterwards. Towns were bypassed, with some turning to ghost towns, as cars and trucks improved and didnt need the endless stops any more.'

        "text": 'You might want to do it all, but you cant at least not without paying a price. Learning to say no or being willing to delegate can help you manage your to-do list and your stress. Healthy boundaries are important in a wellness journey. Everyone has physical and emotional limits. Saying yes may seem like an easy way to keep the peace, prevent conflicts and get the job done right. But instead, it may cause you inner conflict because your needs and those of your family come second. Putting yourself second can lead to stress, anger, resentment and even the wish to take revenge. And thats not a very calm and peaceful reaction. Remember, youre a priority.'

        "text": 'Theres a saying if you dont like the weather in Arkansas or (substitute your state here) just wait a little while, and it will change. The debate over how much the climate is changing has been raging for years, but theres little doubt Midsouth producers are dealing with more variable weather thats forcing them to consider adjustments in how they farm. Whether it’s unusually cold, wet springs, 2021’s foot-and-a-half of rain falling in Southeast Arkansas or 2022’s record heat and drought in June weather conditions have growers and agronomists shaking their heads.'
